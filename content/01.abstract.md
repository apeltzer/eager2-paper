## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The broadening utilisation of ancient DNA (aDNA) to address archaeological,
palaeontological, and biological questions is resulting in a rising diversity in
the size of laboratories and scale of analyses being performed. In the context
of this heterogeneous landscape, we present nf-core/eager, an advanced and
entirely redesigned and extended pipeline for the analysis of ancient genomic
data. This Nextflow pipeline aims to address three main themes: accessibility
and adaptability to different computing configurations, reproducibility to
ensure robust analytical standards, and updating the pipeline to
the latest routine ancient genomic practises. This new version of EAGER has been
developed within the nf-core initiative to ensure high-quality software
development and maintenance support; contributing to a long-term lifecycle for
the pipeline. nf-core/eager will assist in ensuring that ancient DNA sequencing
data can be used by a diverse range of research groups and fields.
