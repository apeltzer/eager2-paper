## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The broadening utilisation of ancient DNA (aDNA) to address archaeological,
palaeontological and biological questions is resulting in a rising diversity in
the size of laboratories and scale of analyses being performed. In the context
of this heterogeneous landscape, we present nf-core/eager, an advanced and
entirely redesigned pipeline for the analysis of ancient genomic data.
nf-core/eager builds on existing ideas and concepts introduced in the original
EAGER pipeline, and improves various aspects of the analysis procedure by
building on computational frameworks such as Nextflow and nf-core. The pipeline
aims to address three main points: accessibility and adaptability to different
research groups and their computing configurations, reproducibility to ensure
robust analytical standards in the field, and updating the EAGER pipeline to the
latest routine ancient genomic practises. This new version of EAGER has been
developed within the nf-core initiative, to ensure high quality software
development and maintenance support; contributing to a long-term lifecycle for
the pipeline. nf-core/eager will assist in ensuring that ancient DNA sequencing
data can be utilised by a diverse range of research groups and fields.
