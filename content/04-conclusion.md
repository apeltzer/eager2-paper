## Conclusion

nf-core/eager is an efficient, portable, and accessible pipeline for processing aDNA genomic data. This re-implementation of EAGER into Nextflow and nf-core will improve reproducibility and inclusion of rapidly increasing aDNA datasets, for both large and small laboratories. Extensive documentation also enables newcomers to the field get a practical understanding on how to interpret aDNA in the context of NGS data processing. Ultimately, nf-core/eager provides easier access to the latest tools and routine screening analyses commonly used in the field, and sets up the pipeline for staying at the forefront of palaeogenetic analysis.
